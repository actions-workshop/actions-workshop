# Part 5 - Deployment

In a previous lab, you used GitHub Actions to package the application into a Docker image and publish the package to the GitHub Container Registry. The next step in a classical **Continuous Delivery Process** is to **deploy** your application.

In this lab you will extend the workflow to deploy the container image to [Azure Web Apps](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/products/app-service/web), a managed Web Application Service that also allows to deploy Containers in Azure.

You will learn how to easily authenticate against a cloud provider using  a simple action, use Actions Variables to define configuration values for your actions and define manual deployment approvals for your environments.

> **Note**
> The Azure Account you will be using in this workshop is provided for you, so you don't have to create one yourself. Access is granted through Organization Secrets which you will learn about in the first step of this lab.

## 1 - Action Variables and secrets

### 1.1 Create a new Action Variable

You have already learned to how utilize variables from within a workflow. But so far, we you were only  using variables that are provided to you by GitHub itself. Let's learn how you can add your own variables (and secrets) to make it easier to define repository-specific configurations and other values that you might not want to hard-code into your workflow files.

1. Navigate to your repositorie's `Settings`, unfold `Secrets and variables` and select `Actions`
    ![Navigate to Actions Secrets](images/005/navigate-to-actions-secrets.png)

2. Let's stop here for a second and recognize that there are already some `Organization secrets` defined (`AZ_CLIENT_ID`, `AZ_SECRET`, `AZ_SUBSCRIPTION_ID`, `AZ_TENANT_ID`). These are secrets created for you by your Organization's administrator and they will allow you to authenticate against Azure with a Service Principal (alias Machine User) to conduct your deployment. You can (and will) access those secrets from within your workflow files under the `secrets`-namespace (so e.g. `secrets.AZ_CLIENT_ID`). You can read more on the scopes of secrets and variables below.

3. Navigate to the `Variables` tab and click on `New repository variable`

    ![Navigate to New repository variable](images/005/navigate-to-variables.png)

4. Use `APP_NAME` as the Name of the variable and provide a value of your choice - preferrably your repositorie's name (as the Appname needs to be unique for all of Azure Web Services, choose something not too simple). Click on `Add variable` once you are done.
    ![Create a new variable](images/005/create-new-variable.png)

Now you have created a variable that will be accessible from all workflows within this repository as `${{ vars.APP_NAME }}` - and we will make use of this in our deployment workflow.

<details>
  <summary>(optional) Understand Azure and the provided secrets</summary>
  
- **AZ_TENANT_ID**: An Azure Tenant is basically the Azure Account itself. So this ID specifies into which Azure Account we are supposed to login and deploy our App to later.
- **AZ_SUBSCRIPTION_ID**: In Azure, a Subscription is a billing unit, meaning that all resources defined beneath it will be billed with the information provided on the subscription. Everything you deploy into azure must be within a subscription - so you can also view it as a Top-Level Grouping Mechanism.
- **AZ_CLIENT_ID** and **AZ_SECERT**: These are the credentials for the machine user (or 'Service Principal' as it is named in Azure) that is used to conduct automated deployments. The `ClientId` is the Username, the `Secret` is the password. There are other ways of authentication (e.g. entirely passwordless throuh OIDC) which are supported by GitHub, but out of scope of this workshop.
  
</details>

### 1.2 Scopes of secrets and variables

As you saw, both variables and secrets can be defined on 3 different scopes:

1. `Environment`: Secrets and variables under this scope are only accessible for jobs that define an `environment`. Environments can be protected, so using this scope is a great way to lock down usage of these variables - but also to make workflows dynamically usable for different environments like deployment targets by reusing the same variable-names. You will learn more about environments in this lab. Environments can be a great way to
2. `Repository`: Secrets and variables defined here are accessible in all workflows of the repository, so they are great for general secrets and variables that you want to use or reuse.
3. `Organization`: Secrets and variables defined here are accessible in all workflows of all repositories of the organization. This is a great way to define secrets and variables that are used across multiple repositories, e.g. for a shared deployment account, as we are doing it in this workshop.

Once a job is executed, all scopes are accumulated into the `secrets` namespace for Secrets and the `vars` namespace for variables.

If two variables from different scopes have the same name, the variable from the scope with the highest precedence is used. The precedence order is the same as above, so `Environment` > `Repository` > `Organization`.

That means if you have a secret on your organization with the name `SECRET` and value `Organization`, and one with the same name in your repository with the value `Repository`, using `${{ secrets.SECRET }}` in your workflow will result in the value `Repository`.

## 2 - Extend the Workflow to deploy to staging

So let's get real and finally come to a deployment. In the previous labs, you built the application and packaged it into a container image published to GitHub Container Registry. To run the application, you need to run the container image. This can be done in a number of ways, such as Azure Container instances or Azure Web Apps for Linux, or hosted in a Kubernetes cluster such as Azure Kubernetes Services (AKS). Azure also provides a managed Web App service called Azure Web Apps that can also run container instances. For this workshop, you will deploy the container image to Azure Web Apps.

A best practice when it comes to deployments is to describe the resources using code (Infrastructure as Code). This project has some [Bicep](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/azure-resource-manager/bicep/overview?tabs=bicep) scripts that describe the entire infraustrcture, but something like Terraform would also work.

### 2.1 Use Infrastructure as Code

The Bicep files for the deployment are in the [`/infra/web-app`](../infra/web-app/) folder in the repo. There are 2 files:

| File            | Description                                                                                                                   |
| --------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `main.bicep`    | The main infrastructure file which creates an Azure Resource Group and invokes the other files to create the full environment |
| `web-app.bicep` | Specifies the app itself - as a Web App for containers                                                                        |

To provision the infrastructure services and deploy the appcation, you can invoke the Azure CLI (`az cli`). You will shortly modify the workflow to add this step. However, first you need to make the Package feed public.

### 2.2 Add the deployment step to workflow

You can now modify the workflow to automate the deployment of the application.

Open the `node.js.yml` file. After the `package-and-publish` job, add the following job:

```yml
  staging:
    name: Deploy to Staging
    needs: [package-and-publish]
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    ## Only deploy after merges to the main branch, not on every PR
    if: github.event_name == 'push' && github.ref == 'refs/heads/main'
    permissions:
      contents: read
    environment:
      name: staging
      url: "${{ steps.deploy.outputs.url }}"

    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v2

      - name: Log in to Azure using OIDC
        uses: azure/login@v1
        with:
          creds: '{"clientId":"${{ secrets.AZ_CLIENT_ID }}","clientSecret":"${{ secrets.AZ_CLIENT_SECRET }}","subscriptionId":"${{ secrets.AZ_SUBSCRIPTION_ID }}","tenantId":"${{ secrets.AZ_TENANT_ID }}"}'

      - name: Deploy resources
        uses: azure/arm-deploy@v1
        id: deploy
        with:
          scope: subscription
          region: westeurope
          deploymentName: ${{ vars.APP_NAME }}-deployment
          template: ./infra/web-app/main.bicep
          parameters: "containerImage=${{ needs.package-and-publish.outputs.container }} actor=${{ github.actor }} appName=aw-${{ vars.APP_NAME }} repository=${{ github.repository }}"

```

Lastly you need to add an [output](https://docs.github.com/en/actions/using-jobs/defining-outputs-for-jobs) to your `package-and-publish` job to get the name of the container image from your registry. This is being used in the Azure deployment to set up the Container hosting.

```yml
     runs-on: ubuntu-latest
     outputs:
      container: ${{ steps.meta.outputs.tags }}
```

<details>
<summary>Check this for an example for the full workflow file</summary>

    steps:

        uses: azure/login@v1

      - name: Deploy resources
        uses: azure/arm-deploy@v1
        id: deploy
        with:
          scope: subscription
          region: westeurope
          deploymentName: ${{ vars.APP_NAME }}-deployment
          template: ./infra/main.bicep
          parameters: "containerImage=${{ needs.package-and-publish.outputs.container }} actor=${{ github.actor }} appName=aw-${{ vars.APP_NAME }} repository=${{ github.repository }}"
```

</details>

The new job performs the following:

- Targets an environment called `staging` - this makes it easier to get an overview of what is deployed where, and have a link to the target right in GitHub.
- Determines the URL of the environment for this by examining the outputs of the `Deploy resources` step, which in turn is reading the output parameter of the Bicep file.
- Checks out the code to get access to the Infrastructure as Code files.
- Logs into Azure using the provided Secrets from your organization.
- Invokes the `azure/arm-deploy` Action to deploy the application to Azure, passing in main template and additional parameters including the `appName` that you provided as Action Variable.

Check in the file - this should trigger the workflow to run.

### 2.4 Navigating to the Environment

1. Once the workflow run completes, you should see a link in the **Deploy to staging** job in the visualizer:

    ![Deployment success](images/005/deploy-success.png)

1. Click on the link to open the application running in Azure!

    ![Running app](images/005/running-app.png)

## 3 - Configuring an Approval on the Environment

Now that the deployment is working, you may want to enforce a manual approval.

1. Navigate to the GitHub repo and click on **Settings**. Click on **Environments** and then click `staging`:

    ![Configure staging](images/005/click-env.png)

1. Ensure that **Required reviewers** is selected and add yourself as a reviewer.
1. Click **Save protection rules** to save your changes:

    ![Configure staging](images/005/approvers.png)

1. (Optional) You can also see the other environment options such as **Wait timers** and **Deployment branches** that let you specify which branches can be deployed to this environment.
1. The next time you push code, the workflow will pause on the **Deploy to Staging** job to wait for approval before executing the job steps.

## Conclusion
