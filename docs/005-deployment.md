# Part 5 - Deployment

There are several ways to conduct the deployment step of this workshop. The method you choose will largely depend on whether you are doing this workshop entirely on your own or if someone is guiding you.

For the guided workshops, you can find guides on how to prepare the deployment environment in the [Deployment Environment](https://github.com/actions-workshop/deployment-environment) which accompanies this workshop.

Select the method that seems most appropriate for your situation or the one recommended by your trainer:
